🔍 What You Already Have (8 Features) CMS PFS / CPT monitoring + automatic $ impact calculator ✅ Super valuable. Clinics need to understand reimbursement changes. ⚠️ Missing piece: device list + CPT linking (you’ll need an onboarding flow where clinics manually enter their devices + CPT codes so you can map them to CMS updates). FDA drug recalls & shortage alerts (contrast agents, anesthetics) ✅ Core compliance. Must be real-time + source-linked. ⚠️ You’ll need a backend pipeline: Poll FDA drug recalls & shortage feeds (openFDA + FDA Enforcement Reports). Filter for radiology-related drugs (contrast, anesthesia). Push alert within minutes. Device pre-emptive detection (openFDA + MAUDE) ✅ Smart feature. You’re offering an early-warning system. Logic: if MAUDE adverse events spike for a device, and/or FDA recall notices appear → flag as “pre-alert.” This is national, not personalized, but differentiates you (most competitors don’t offer preemptive). Audit deadline tracking & reminders (CMS, Federal Register, MQSA, CA registry) ✅ Crucial. Compliance calendars are always a headache. ⚠️ Missing: State-level licensing (CA Radiation Control Program deadlines). Accreditation reminders (ACR, Joint Commission if they do imaging). OSHA / HIPAA Security Risk Assessment (SRA) compliance deadlines. Radiology-relevant news from regulators (FDA, CMS, State DOH) ✅ Good, but this should feel like a curated feed, not spam. Add urgency tags (Critical / Action Required / FYI). Always show source. MAUDE monitoring (supportive, not auto-alert unless corroborated) ✅ This is already partly in feature #3, but useful as a “supporting evidence” channel. Summary + newsletter ✅ Keeps engagement high. Could be weekly “RegIntel Digest: What Changed This Week in Radiology Compliance.” Highlight only what matters (e.g., “2 recalls, 1 CPT reimbursement cut, 1 upcoming audit deadline”). One dashboard: compliance + audit + insurance + breakthrough news (ranked by urgency) ✅ Excellent concept → a single “Command Center.” Urgency-based ranking is your USP (clinics don’t want to dig through noise). Breakthroughs and general radiology news = nice-to-have (but should always be below compliance items). 🚨 What’s Still Missing Here’s what I’d add to make this a bulletproof platform: A) Insurance & Payer Updates Payers like Aetna, Anthem, Medicare Advantage constantly update prior authorization & coverage rules (esp. for advanced imaging like MRI, PET). This is mission-critical for clinics, because denied claims = direct money loss. None of your competitors do this well → strong USP. B) State-Specific Licensing & Rules CA Department of Public Health: Radiologic Health Branch licensing deadlines, state-specific forms. Workers’ comp (California WC imaging rules differ). If you’re CA-focused, this makes your product impossible to replace with a generic national competitor. C) OSHA / Radiation Safety Compliance OSHA workplace safety reminders (annual safety audits, radiation safety officer requirements). ALARA compliance updates. These are non-billing but regulators love fining for them. D) HIPAA / Cybersecurity Alerts OCR (Office for Civil Rights) HIPAA settlements & guidance updates. Cyber incidents affecting imaging software or PACS vendors. Growing threat → if you include even basic “HIPAA risk alerts,” clinics will feel safer. E) Benchmarking & Financial Tools Compare a clinic’s CPT reimbursement trends to statewide/national averages. Show how much a recall / shortage might cost them financially. Adds ROI clarity → you’re not just alerting, you’re quantifying impact. 🎯 Refined Full Scope (if we stitch it together) CPT & reimbursement monitoring ($ impact). FDA drug/device recalls + shortages. Preemptive device failure detection (MAUDE + openFDA signals). Compliance deadline calendar (federal + CA + accreditation). Regulatory news feed (ranked by urgency). MAUDE monitoring (supportive evidence). Newsletter / digest. Unified dashboard (compliance → insurance → news). Insurance payer policy updates. State-specific licensing & WC rules. OSHA + radiation safety reminders. HIPAA / cybersecurity alerts. Financial benchmarking (optional, but powerful). 👉 If you stop at your 8 points → you’re a solid alert/news product. 👉 If you add the 5 I mentioned → you become the compliance & operations nerve center for CA radiology. That’s a USP nobody else has.
